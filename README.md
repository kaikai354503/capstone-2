Project Description



The DELI program is a Java-based console application designed to take orders,  process for our custom sandwich shop. This project automates order customization, calculates pricing in real-time, and ensures accurate transaction logging.

The solution involves Object-Oriented programming, using concepts like Polymorphism and Inheritance to manage various product types (Sandwiches, Drinks, Chips) and complex pricing for customizable items like premium toppings.

Key Features:

Customizable Sandwiches: Supports three sizes (4", 8", 12"), various breads, and separate pricing logic for premium (Meats, Cheeses) and regular toppings.


Detailed Receipts: Saves a detailed receipt for every finalized order, timestamped and formatted as YYYYMMDD-HHmmss.txt, into a dedicated receipts folder.

Menu-Driven Interface: User-friendly navigation through Home, Order, Customization, and Checkout screens.
